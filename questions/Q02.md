## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer

Base64 is used to encode binary data into an ASCII string format by translating it into something called a radix-64 representation. It is used to construct a JWT because Base64 or rather Base64url is a very popular and widely accepted encoding format, so most languages can use it. Also, it is url safe, meaning it's ok to send them through the url.
